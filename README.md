# Deep Learning with PyTorch

This repository provides implementations of deep learning models using PyTorch, showcasing various neural network architectures and their applications in tasks like image classification, natural language processing, and more.

## Introduction
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that employs neural networks with multiple layers to identify and learn patterns in data. This repository serves as a platform to experiment with and understand deep learning techniques using PyTorch.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deep-learning-pytorch.git
    cd deep-learning-pytorch
    ```
2. Set up a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Features
- Ready-to-use implementations of neural network architectures like CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers.
- Tools for dataset preprocessing and augmentation.
- Modular training and evaluation workflows.
- Visualization of results through metrics and graphs.

## Usage
1. Prepare the dataset:
    ```bash
    python preprocess.py --dataset <dataset_path>
    ```
2. Train a model:
    ```bash
    python train.py --model <model_name> --epochs <num_epochs> --batch_size <batch_size>
    ```
3. Evaluate the model:
    ```bash
    python evaluate.py --model <model_name> --test_data <test_data_path>
    ```
## Models and Experiments
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Ideal for image-related tasks.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** Suitable for sequential data.
- **Transformers:** Effective for natural language processing tasks.
